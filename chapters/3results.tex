    \section{Non-cooperative enzymes do not entail bistable systems}
        %
        Considering a system without cooperative enzymes, that thus only contains enzymes with a context that includes the next neighbours at most, bistability can not be achieved. Indeed, fig. \ref{img:linearCase} discloses a monostable system, as the histogram shows an unimodal distribution throughout the simulation.\\ % Link to more simulation results in appendix?
        %
        \begin{figure}[htpb!]
            \centering
            % \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{}
            \caption{Boring monostable case. The rule sets used the following enzymes: ? (Rates and additional runs can be found in Appendix.)}
            \label{img:linearCase}
        \end{figure}
        %
        Fig. \ref{img:linearCase} exemplarily shows that the total number of active and silent states ambulate around one same value. In fig. % TODO make figure
        , one can see that even though the overall number of active and silent states changes over time, the overall order in the system stays invariant as the only enzymatic actions are taking place in between the two modification areas at their border. % TODO Discussion: In a case of symmetrical rule set rates, the border will always stay in the middle, because stochastics?
