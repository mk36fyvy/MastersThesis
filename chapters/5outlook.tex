    explain that PREs (Polycomb response elements) are responsible for the chromatin forming loops (TADs = topologically associating domains) and are thus able to form large silenced areas of condensed chromatin. These 3D-formations are critical for HOX gene regulation. It is also known that many active gene promoters interact with their enhancers and other promoters in a 3d-fashion. \cite{javierre2016lineage} These findings suggest that it might be beneficial for \ed simulations to further explore possibilities to emulate fixed and dynamic 3D interactions within the nucleosome string.
